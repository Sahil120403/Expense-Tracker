# Expense-Tracker
This Java-based Expense Tracker application is designed to help users manage and monitor their personal finances efficiently. The project includes both a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Java Swing and a command-line interface (CLI) version that integrates with a MySQL database using JDBC. Users can input expenses by selecting predefined categories such as Food, Shopping, Transportation, Medical, and more, along with the amount and a brief description. The GUI provides a clean and interactive way to add, delete, and view expenses, displaying category-wise totals and the overall spending summary in real time. For more advanced usage or persistence, the CLI version allows users to store their data in a MySQL database, ensuring records are retained even after closing the application. The database includes automatic table creation and basic error handling, making the app reliable and beginner-friendly. This dual-mode expense tracker combines intuitive user experience with practical backend storage, making it a handy tool for daily budgeting and expense tracking.
